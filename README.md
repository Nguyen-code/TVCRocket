# About TVCRocket

This project was simultaneously one of the most challenging and most fun project I've done in a while. I put myself on an extremely strict deadline, only 6 weeks (because I wanted to submit some of the work to colleges for applications) and I'm pleased with the progress I was able to make in that time. Going forward, I'm excited to continue development in future versions.

# Design Intent

The overarching goal of this project was to design and develop an active stability system for rockets on the model scale to learn more about robust hardware, software, and mechanical design. Although the first version didn't exactly work perfectly, I learned __SO MUCH__ and am excited to continue on version two, hopefully in the spring of 2021.
